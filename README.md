# Neuromorphic Robot
This was a semester research project at ETH ZÃ¼rich, at the Institute for Neural Informatics.
It was conducted in the spring semester of 2019, during my last Bachelor's semester of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.


In the report you can find the experiments we conducted, as well as the results. For this project we received the grade 5.5/6.0.

Many thanks to our supervisor, as well as to my team mate Nikola.
